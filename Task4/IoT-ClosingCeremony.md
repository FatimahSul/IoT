# How Can We Use the Internet of Things in The Closing Ceremony?!

## The Internet of Things (IoT) can be utilized in robots to improve their capabilities and enable them to connect and communicate with other devices and systems through the Internet. The following are some ideas to utilize Iot in the closing ceremony: 

### Controlling Robots <br />
IoT enables the remote monitoring and control of robots, allowing users to access and control the robots anywhere with an internet connection.
### Remote Participation  <br />
We can use Telepresence robots to allow trainees to participate in the ceremony remotely, making it accessible to everyone. 
### Customer Service and Telecommuting  <br />
We can use Telepresence robots to help answer questions about the ceremony. Telepresence robots can minimize the workload on staff and improve response times to inquiries. IF for example, the staff are busy with the ceremony the robots will still be there to help. Since the company have more than one ceremony held on different dates with different staff, customer service can still be offered while allowing employees to work from any location with internet access.
### Automation  <br />
Telepresence robots can also be integrated with automation systems to control various devices remotely. 
### Security and Monitoring  <br />
These robots will give attendance a sense of security and peace of mind, as staff can undertake virtual tours from anywhere with an internet connection and keep an eye on the ceremony. Telepresence robots can be integrated with smart security systems, providing real-time video monitoring and remote access to devices in the place where the ceremony is held.
### Predictive Maintenance  <br />
IoT integration enables robots to monitor their own health and performance by collecting and analyzing sensor data. Since we worked on adding a temperature and humidity sensor, we can use the data gathered to monitor the robot.

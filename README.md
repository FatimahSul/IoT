## About this repository 
This repository includes my work as a trainee at Smart Methods Company in the IoT Path (2023).

## Task 1
### ESP-LED Simulator

Build an ESP-led Simulator that fetches an HTML page and acts accordingly. 
My ESP-led Simulator is built with 5 LEDs, representing the four directions the robot can move in `left, right, forward, backward` and a fifth red led which represents `stop`.

### Preview

#### Simulation outputs:
Two HTML pages are used in this simulation ( https://s-m.com.sa/f.html / https://s-m.com.sa/s.html). When fetched, the first page returns `forward`, and the later page returns `stop`. Depending on which page is contained in the const `url` two outputs are expected: either the 4 purple LEDs will be turned on, or the single red led will be turned on and the rest will be turned off. <br />
